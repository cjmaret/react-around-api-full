Around The U.S. - Full API Site

Intro: This project is part of the Practicum Web Development course (sprint 12 to 15). It's an interactive page called 'Around The U.S.' where users can add, remove and like image cards. The webpage is fully responsive, connected to a backend server hosted on Google Cloud Platform. 

Project description
The page consists of image cards which are rendered from an API server, shared with other students. New cards can be added by submitting a popup form that requires a title and an image URL as inputs. When the user clicks on the card, a modal window with full size image and image caption will open.
The backend server contains a database which consists of the user info and ID's of signed up users, as well as the card data belonging to each of them.
A token application was added, which is saved in the user's localStorage, so any repeat visits to the site will allow the users to bypass the signin page and access their homepage directly.
